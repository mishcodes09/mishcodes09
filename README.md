### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Iâ€™m Mish â€” a curious and creative front-end developer who loves building smooth, thoughtful digital experiences.

I enjoy turning ideas into clean, responsive interfaces and learning new things along the way.

Outside of coding, youâ€™ll usually find me skating, crocheting, or working on my next side project. I also enjoy sharing what I learn through visuals, writing, and community projects.
### âœ¨ Fun Facts

- â˜• Not a fan of coffee or tea  
- ðŸŽ¨ I believe small details make a big difference
